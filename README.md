# Visual Argument

Initially, I wanted to create something that shows the effects of climate change. After brainstorming an effective way to demonstrate this, I decided to focus more on the effects of the fashion industry on the earth. I included a dumpster full of clothes and Kim Kardashian who is known for having,posting and collaborating with fast fashion brands. On top of it, I included a quote that says "Its called fashion. Look it up." This is in reference to a meme that was going around a couple of years ago. The rhetorical goals of this image was to use irony to show the effects of fast fashion.
