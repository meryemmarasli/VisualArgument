# VisualArgument

The purpose of this project is to show how fast fashion effects earth. I included a dumpster full of clothes and Kim Kardashian who is known for having and posting fast fashion brands. On top of it, I included a quote that says "Its called fashion. Look it up." This is in reference to a meme that was going around a couple of years ago. The rhetorical goals of this image was irony and showing the effects of fast fashion.
